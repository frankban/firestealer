============

To setup the development environment, run `make sysdeps` once and then
`make dev`. At this point the `fsteal` command is available at
`devenv/bin/fsteal` and the project itself is installed in editable mode in
the `devenv` virtual environment.

See `make help` for a description of other make targets.
